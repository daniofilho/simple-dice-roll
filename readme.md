# Simples Dice Roll

Yes, it's a simple dice roll animation made with ThreeJS.

[DEMO](https://simple-dice-roll.vercel.app/)

**@TODO**

- [ ] make a better animation (this ones looks too fake)
- [ ] make animation smoother when transitioning from random rotation to the new dice rotation coordinates;
- [ ] make dice looks better, it's too "square";
- [ ] fix the screen flickering when state changes;
- [ ] Bug: sometimes the dice rotation does not work, why?
